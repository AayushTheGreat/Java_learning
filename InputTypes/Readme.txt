`BufferedReader` is a fast and efficient class in Java for reading text from an input source. It reads data into a memory buffer in large chunks, which makes it much quicker than reading one character at a time, especially for large inputs. 

## Key Characteristics

    1. Reads Only Strings: It reads text line by line using the `readLine()` method. All input is captured as a `String`.

    2. Manual Parsing Required: You are always responsible for converting the `String` input into other data types, like numbers (e.g., using `Integer.parseInt()` or `Double.parseDouble()`).

    3. Checked Exceptions: Its methods can throw an `IOException`, a type of error that you are required to handle in your code, making it more robust.

    4.Thread-Safe: `BufferedReader` is synchronized, meaning it's safe to use in multi-threaded applications without causing data corruption.


Scanner is a versatile and user-friendly class in Java for reading input from sources like the console. It breaks down input into individual "tokens" (like words or numbers) that can be easily converted into different data types.

## Key Characteristics
    1. Convenient Parsing: It has built-in methods like nextInt(), nextDouble(), and nextBoolean() that automatically read and convert input into primitive types, requiring no manual parsing from you.

    2. Token-Based Reading: It reads input in chunks ("tokens") separated by whitespace by default. The next() method reads just the next token, while nextLine() reads the rest of the current line.

    3. Beginner-Friendly with a Catch: While very easy for simple programs, it has a common pitfall when mixing number-reading methods (like nextInt()) with nextLine(), which requires careful handling.

    4. Not Thread-Safe: It is not synchronized, which means it is not safe for use in multi-threaded applications without external controls.

    5. Unchecked Exceptions: If the input doesn't match the expected type (e.g., typing "hello" for nextInt()), it throws an InputMismatchException, which is an unchecked exception.




`JOptionPane` is a simple class in Java's Swing toolkit used to create standard, pop-up dialog boxes. It's the quickest way to interact with a user in a GUI application without building a full custom window. 

## Key Characteristics

    1. Effortless Pop-ups : It provides static methods (like `showInputDialog` and `showMessageDialog`) that create and show a fully functional dialog box with a single line of code.

    2. Always Returns a String: When used for input, it **always returns the user's entry as a `String`**. You are responsible for converting this string into other data types (e.g., using `Integer.parseInt()`).

    3. Modal Behavior: By default, its dialogs are **modal**, which means they block user interaction with the rest of the application until the dialog is closed. The user must respond to the pop-up before continuing.

    4. Built-in Cancel Handling: If the user clicks the "Cancel" button or closes the dialog window, the input method gracefully returns **`null`**. Your code must check for this `null` value to handle cancellations properly.



DataInputStream is a class in Java used for reading binary data (raw bytes) from an input source. It's designed to read primitive Java data types and strings that were written in a machine-independent format, typically by a DataOutputStream.

## Key Characteristics

    1. Reads Binary Data, Not Text: Its primary purpose is to read data that is not human-readable, like the contents of a saved file from an application. It interprets bytes directly as numbers, characters, etc.

    2. Paired with DataOutputStream : It's almost always used to read data that was written by a DataOutputStream. This pairing ensures the data is read in the exact same format it was written.

    3. Specific read<Type>() Methods: It has a dedicated method for each primitive type, such as readInt(), readDouble(), readBoolean(), and readUTF() for reading strings.

    4. End-of-File Exception : Unlike readers that return null, DataInputStream throws an EOFException (End of File Exception) when you try to read past the end of the available data. This is often used to signal the end of a reading loop.
